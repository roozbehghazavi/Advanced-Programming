      •The indication "K." or KV refers to "Köchel (Verzeichnis)", i.e. the (more or less) chronological (i.e. by composition date) catalog of Mozart's works by Ludwig von Köchel. Note that this catalog has been amended several times, leading to ambiguity over some KV numbers (see e.g. Symphony No. 25). A version of the Köchel catalog can be found here and here.

    <RadzenHtml>
      •The compositions of Mozart listed below are grouped thematically, i.e. by type of composition. Not all thematic groups of Mozart's works have a separate numbering that is generally accepted: Köchel only numbers Symphonies (1 to 41); Piano concertos (1 to 27, leaving out some early transcriptions by Mozart) and a few other groups, on the other hand, for string quartets, most chamber music and vocal music there is no such numbering (or at least no general accepted one).
    </RadzenHtml>
    <RadzenHtml>
      •Only relatively few of Mozart's compositions have Opus numbers, as not so many of his compositions were published during his lifetime, so numbering by Opus number proves quite impractical for Mozart compositions.

      Mozart's symphonic production covers a 24 year interval, from 1764 to 1788. According to most recent investigations, Mozart wrote not just the 41 symphonies reported in traditional editions, but up to 68 complete works of this type. However, by convention, the original numbering has been retained, and so his last symphony is still known as "No. 41". Some of the symphonies (K .297, 385, 550) were revised by the author after their first versions.<br>

      These symphonies are sometimes subcategorized as "Early" (1771-1773) and "Late" (1773-1775), and sometimes subcategorized as "Germanic" (with minuet) or "Italian" (without minuet). None of these were printed during Mozart's lifetime.<br>Although not counted as 'symphonies' the three Divertimenti K. 136-138, in 3-movement Italian overture style, are sometimes indicated as 'Salzburg Symphonies' too.<br>

      The three final symphonies (Nos. 39-41) were completed in about three months in 1788. It is quite likely that he hoped to publish these three works together as a single opus, although actually they remained unpublished until after his death. One or two of them might have been played in public in Leipzig in 1789.

      Five violin concertos were written in his late teens while he was still touring with his father throughout Europe, an exceptional feat for a travelling composer. Mozart's Violin Concertos are notable for the beauty of their melodies and the skillful use of the expressive and technical characteristics of the instrument, though Mozart probably never went through all the violin possibilities like others (e.g. Beethoven and Brahms) did after him. (Alfred Einstein notes that the violin concerto–like sections in the serenades are more virtuosic than in the works titled Violin Concertos.)

      Arguably the most widely played concertos for horn, the four Horn Concertos are a major part of most professional horn players' repertoire. It is said that Mozart wrote them for his friend and lifelong companion, Joseph Ignaz Leitgeb. The concertos (especially the fourth) were written as virtuoso vehicles that allow the soloist to show a variety of abilities. (In Mozart's time the horn had no valves making it a very difficult piece.)<br>
      
      The Horn Concertos are characterized by an elegant and humorous dialogue between the soloist and the orchestra. Many of the autographs contain jokes aimed at the dedicatee.

      Mozart's earliest composition attempts begin with piano sonatas and other piano pieces, as this is the instrument on which his musical education took place. Almost everything that he wrote for piano was intended to be played by himself (or by his sister, also a proficient piano player). Examples of his earliest works are those found in Nannerl's Music Book. Between 1782 and 1786 he wrote 20 works for piano solo (including sonatas, variations, fantasias, suites, fugues, rondo) and works for piano four hands and two pianos.

      He also wrote for piano and violin (16 complete sonatas, plus several fragments and two variation sets), where - mainly in the more mature years - the piano does not play just a support to the other solo instrument, but builds a dialogue with it.

          This cycle, in three movements, is interesting as far as these works can be considered precursors of the later - more complete - string quartets.<br>

      <br>
          Much more stylistically developed. In Vienna Mozart is believed to have heard the op. 17 and op. 20 quartets of Joseph Haydn, and had received from them a deep impression. Even if Mozart tries in these works to emulate the older musician, he still cannot reach Haydn's heights in the most difficult of all the musical genres.<br>

      <br>
          Mozart returned to the quartet in the early 1780s after he had moved to Vienna, met Haydn in person, and developed a friendship with the older composer. Haydn had just published his set of six quartets Opus 33, which are thought to have been a stimulus to Mozart in returning to the genre. These quartets are often regarded as among the pinnacles of the genre.<br>

          •String Quartet No. 20 in D major ("Hoffmeister"), K. 499 (1786)<br>
      <br>
          This work was published by (dedicated to?) Franz Anton Hoffmeister, as well as the Prussian Quartets. Mozart's last three quartets, dedicated to the King of Prussia Friedrich Wilhelm II, are noted for the cantabile character of the parts for cello (the instrument played by the king himself), the sweetness of sounds and the equilibrium among the different instruments.<br>

      The production for instrumental ensembles includes several Divertimenti, Notturni, Serenades, Cassations, Marches, and Dances, besides, of course, the Symphonies. Mozart's production for orchestra is written for string ensembles (like the early Divertimenti K. 136–138), as well as for wind instruments ensembles and the varied combinations of string and wind.
      
      Mozart left a huge production of dances for orchestra, including the genres of Minuetto (more than 100), Contredanse and Allemande (or Teitsch, or Laendler).
      
      In his production of minuets, Mozart generally followed Haydn's example, preferring the slow character of the dance. Allemandes (56 between 1787 and 1791) were written mainly for public balls in Vienna. In the Contredanse production, also written mainly in Vienna, some examples of program music are found, like Il Temporale K. 535, La Bataille K. 600, Canarino K. 602, etc.
